# STAT545A Homework 1 repo of Rebecca Asiimwe 

### Hi & Welcome to my [STAT545](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC) homework 1 repo. 

#### A quick walk through my repo:

|   **File**   | **Description** |
|----------------|------------|
|[README.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe/blob/master/README.md)|The readme.md file provides an overview of the ghist of my repo |
|[hw01_gapminder.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.Rmd)      | Data analysis and exploration of the gapminder dataset using R   |

## About me:

My name is Rebecca Asiimwe. I am a masters student in the [MSc. Bioinformatics program](ubc bioinformatics) at UBC. I come from an IT background that heavily revolved around working with computer networks,information systems, programming and working with databases; I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology and a Masters degree in Information Technology; however, I still seemed to be inclined to Biology!!!. My love for Biology drove me into Bioinformatics and I am loving it :smile:

## Current Research:
<p align = "justify"> I am currenly working on using data from whole genome seqeuncing to understand the underlying molecular and genomic underpinings behind Triple Negative Breast Cancer which is the most aggresive type of Breast Cancer. My work also takes on a database drive appoach of probing mutations using postrgesql and thereon conducting data analysis using python and R. I am currenlty \based at the [BC Cancer Agency](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca) and work in the [Computational Biology lab](http://shahlab.ca) of Dr. Sohrab Shah</p> 
_Among the things we do in the lab involve understanding:_

1. *Cancer Evolution*
2. *Software developent*
3. *Single cell genomics of cancer*
4. *Selection and drug response*
  * *Why do some patients respond to treatment and others dont?* ~~:wonder:~~ :thinking: 
    + Well, we all have different genetic makeups but thanks to Next Generation Sequencing, we are begining to understand diseases more and find drugable targets for non responsive patients
    - The tumor-micro environemts differ and also have a large bearing on tumor evolution
5. *Mutational signatures in DNA repair deficient cancers*

In line code: `4^3 = 64` 

##Code blocks

<p> Example Code:</p>
<pre><code>if(z > 0){
  print("Number greater than zero")
} 
else 
{
  print("Number less than zero")
}
</code></pre>
