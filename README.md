## About me:

My name is Rebecca Asiimwe. I am a masters student in the [MSc. Bioinformatics program](ubc bioinformatics) at UBC. I come from an IT background that heavily revolved around working with computer networks,information systems, programming and working with databases; I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology and a Masters degree in Information Technology; however, I still seemed to be inclined to Biology!!!. My love for Biology drove me into Bioinformatics and I am loving it :smile:
